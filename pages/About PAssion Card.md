				<b>PASSION CARD - THE BEGINNING</b>
<span>
Introduced in April 2005, the PAssion Card is a membership card of the People’s Association (PA).  Besides offering members’ exclusive privileges for our exciting range of courses, activities and programmes, the PAssion Card also offers unique promotions via our tie-ups with our lifestyle merchants and partners. However, the PAssion Card is more than just another membership or discount card as it serves the unique purpose of bringing people together via a host of exciting and wholesome programmes and activities organised by the People’s Association (PA), Community Clubs (CCs) and other PA outlets.</span>
<span>
In November 2009, PA enhanced the PAssion Card by incorporating the Contactless ePurse Application (CEPAS) technology into the card.  The PAssion “EZ-Link” Card is the first membership card in Singapore to be incorporated with the new EZ-Link purse that complies with the Singapore Standard for CEPAS and brings about greater convenience and added functionalities to the end user.  With this Card, PA has helped Singapore in its goal of being a SMART Nation.
