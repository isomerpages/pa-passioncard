<p>[SCAM ALERT] Scammers are actively targeting POSB customers, including PAssion-POSB Cardholders, through a phishing email, which claims to be a “POSB-PAssion Rewards 2022!” survey. The email, which contains clickable links, adds that 500 customers who fill out the survey will receive a cash reward or air miles. This is <strong>NOT a legitimate email</strong> from POSB, PA or PAssion Card.<br>
<br>
Please note that DBS/POSB <strong>does not send retail customers emails and SMSes that contain clickable links.</strong><br>
<br>
If you have provided your PAssion POSB debit card details and CVV combination to this phishing website or any other non-DBS websites or mobile applications, please call POSB/DBS at their 24/7 anti-fraud reporting hotline 1800-339-6963 for immediate assistance.&nbsp;<br>
